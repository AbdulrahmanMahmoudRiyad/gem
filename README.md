# GEM - Graphics Engine for Mathematical animations

## Overview

GEM is a graphics engine designed for creating and rendering 2D animations, focusing on Bézier curves and dynamic animation libraries. The project uses `raylib` for graphics rendering and integrates FFmpeg for audio/video output.

## Features

- **Bézier Curve Rendering**: Supports rendering of complex Bézier curves.
- **Dynamic Library Support**: Load and execute animation libraries at runtime (`libplug.so`).
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Render animations as videos with audio using FFmpeg.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Linux and Windows with platform-specific adjustments.

### Prerequisites

- CMake
- raylib
- FFmpeg

### Notes

1. The project is incomplete and still under development
2. Incomplete Testing, Limited User Interface, The scope of rendering is limited to basic curves and simple assets.
